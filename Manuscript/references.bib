abstract = {The majority of methods available to model survival data only deal with right censoring. However, there are many applications where left, right and/or interval censoring simultaneously occur. A methodology that is capable of handling all types of censoring as well as flexibly estimating several types of covariate effects is presented. The baseline hazard is modelled through monotonic P-splines. The model's parameters are estimated using an efficient and stable penalised likelihood algorithm. The proposed framework is evaluated in simulation, and illustrated using an original data example on time to first hospital infection or in-hospital death in cirrhotic patients. A peak of risk in the first week since hospitalisation is identified, together with a non-linear effect of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The GJRM R package, with an implementation of our approach, is freely available on CRAN.},

 abstract = {We propose a penalized polynomial spline method for simultaneous model estimation and variable selection in additive models. It approximates nonparametric functions by polynomial splines, and minimizes the sum of squared errors subject to an additive penalty on norms of spline functions. This approach sets estimators of certain function components to zero, thus performing variable selection. Under mild conditions, we show that the newly proposed method estimates the non-zero function components in the model with the same optimal mean square convergence rate as the standard polynomial spline estimators, and correctly sets the zero function components to zero with probability approaching one, as n goes to infinity. Besides being theoretically justified, the proposed method is easy to understand and straightforward to implement. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies show the newly proposed method compares favorably with the existing ones in finite sample performance. We also illustrate the use of the proposed method by analyzing two data sets.},

  abstractNote={Cox proportional hazards model is one of the most popular models in biomedical data analysis. There have been continuing efforts to improve the flexibility of such models for complex signal detection, for example, via additive functions. Nevertheless, the task to extend Cox additive models to accommodate high-dimensional data is nontrivial. When estimating additive functions, commonly used group sparse regularization may introduce excess smoothing shrinkage on additive functions, damaging predictive performance. Moreover, an “all-in-all-out” approach makes functional selection challenging to answer if nonlinear effects exist. We develop an additive Cox PH model to address these challenges in high-dimensional data analysis. Notably, we impose a novel spike-and-slab LASSO prior that motivates the bi-level functional selection on additive functions. A scalable and deterministic algorithm, EM-Coordinate Descent, is designed for scalable model fitting. We compare the predictive and computational performance against state-of-the-art models in simulation studies and metabolomics data analysis. The proposed model is broadly applicable to various fields of research, e.g. genomics and population health, via the freely available R package BHAM (https://boyiguo1.github.io/BHAM/).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the Genetics Society of America. Large-scale “omics” data have been increasingly used as an important resource for prognostic prediction of diseases and detection of associated genes. However, there are considerable challenges in analyzing high-dimensional molecular data, including the large number of potential molecular predictors, limited number of samples, and small effect of each predictor. We propose new Bayesian hierarchical generalized linear models, called spike-and-slab lasso GLMs, for prognostic prediction and detection of associated genes using large-scale molecular data. The proposed model employs a spike-and-slab mixture double-exponential prior for coefficients that can induce weak shrinkage on large coefficients, and strong shrinkage on irrelevant coefficients. We have developed a fast and stable algorithm to fit large-scale hierarchal GLMs by incorporating expectation-maximization (EM) steps into the fast cyclic coordinate descent algorithm. The proposed approach integrates nice features of two popular methods, i.e., penalized lasso and Bayesian spike-and-slab variable selection. The performance of the proposed method is assessed via extensive simulation studies. The results show that the proposed approach can provide not only more accurate estimates of the parameters, but also better prediction. We demonstrate the proposed procedure on two cancer data sets: a well-known breast cancer data set consisting of 295 tumors, and expression data of 4919 genes; and the ovarian cancer data set from TCGA with 362 tumors, and expression data of 5336 genes. Our analyses show that the proposed procedure can generate powerful models for predicting outcomes and detecting associated genes.

abstract = {Group structures among genes encoded in functional relationships or biological pathways are valuable and unique features in large-scale molecular data for survival analysis. However, most of previous approaches for molecular data analysis ignore such group structures. It is desirable to develop powerful analytic methods for incorporating valuable pathway information for predicting disease survival outcomes and detecting associated genes. We here propose a Bayesian hierarchical Cox survival model, called the group spike-and-slab lasso Cox (gsslasso Cox), for predicting disease survival outcomes and detecting associated genes by incorporating group structures of biological pathways. Our hierarchical model employs a novel prior on the coefficients of genes, i.e., the group spike-and-slab double-exponential distribution, to integrate group structures and to adaptively shrink the effects of genes. We have developed a fast and stable deterministic algorithm to fit the proposed models. We performed extensive simulation studies to assess the model fitting properties and the prognostic performance of the proposed method, and also applied our method to analyze three cancer data sets. Both the theoretical and empirical studies show that the proposed method can induce weaker shrinkage on predictors in an active pathway, thereby incorporating the biological similarity of genes within a same pathway into the hierarchical modeling. Compared with several existing methods, the proposed method can more accurately estimate gene effects and can better predict survival outcomes. For the three cancer data sets, the results show that the proposed method generates more powerful models for survival prediction and detecting associated genes.
