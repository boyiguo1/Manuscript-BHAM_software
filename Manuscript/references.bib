abstract = {Challenging research in various fields has driven a wide range of methodological advances in variable selection for regression models with high-dimensional predictors. In comparison, selection of nonlinear functions in models with additive predictors has been considered only more recently. Several competing suggestions have been developed at about the same time and often do not refer to each other. This article provides a state-of-the-art review on function selection, focusing on penalized likelihood and Bayesian concepts, relating various approaches to each other in a unified framework. In an empirical comparison, also including boosting, we evaluate several methods through applications to simulated and real data, thereby providing some guidance on their performance in practice. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

@article{Marra2021,
abstract = {The majority of methods available to model survival data only deal with right censoring. However, there are many applications where left, right and/or interval censoring simultaneously occur. A methodology that is capable of handling all types of censoring as well as flexibly estimating several types of covariate effects is presented. The baseline hazard is modelled through monotonic P-splines. The model's parameters are estimated using an efficient and stable penalised likelihood algorithm. The proposed framework is evaluated in simulation, and illustrated using an original data example on time to first hospital infection or in-hospital death in cirrhotic patients. A peak of risk in the first week since hospitalisation is identified, together with a non-linear effect of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The GJRM R package, with an implementation of our approach, is freely available on CRAN.},
