abstract = {The majority of methods available to model survival data only deal with right censoring. However, there are many applications where left, right and/or interval censoring simultaneously occur. A methodology that is capable of handling all types of censoring as well as flexibly estimating several types of covariate effects is presented. The baseline hazard is modelled through monotonic P-splines. The model's parameters are estimated using an efficient and stable penalised likelihood algorithm. The proposed framework is evaluated in simulation, and illustrated using an original data example on time to first hospital infection or in-hospital death in cirrhotic patients. A peak of risk in the first week since hospitalisation is identified, together with a non-linear effect of Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. The GJRM R package, with an implementation of our approach, is freely available on CRAN.},

 abstract = {We propose a penalized polynomial spline method for simultaneous model estimation and variable selection in additive models. It approximates nonparametric functions by polynomial splines, and minimizes the sum of squared errors subject to an additive penalty on norms of spline functions. This approach sets estimators of certain function components to zero, thus performing variable selection. Under mild conditions, we show that the newly proposed method estimates the non-zero function components in the model with the same optimal mean square convergence rate as the standard polynomial spline estimators, and correctly sets the zero function components to zero with probability approaching one, as n goes to infinity. Besides being theoretically justified, the proposed method is easy to understand and straightforward to implement. Extensive Monte Carlo simulation studies show the newly proposed method compares favorably with the existing ones in finite sample performance. We also illustrate the use of the proposed method by analyzing two data sets.},

  title={A scalable and flexible Cox proportional hazards model for high-dimensional survival prediction and functional selection},
  url={http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.11600},
  abstractNote={Cox proportional hazards model is one of the most popular models in biomedical data analysis. There have been continuing efforts to improve the flexibility of such models for complex signal detection, for example, via additive functions. Nevertheless, the task to extend Cox additive models to accommodate high-dimensional data is nontrivial. When estimating additive functions, commonly used group sparse regularization may introduce excess smoothing shrinkage on additive functions, damaging predictive performance. Moreover, an “all-in-all-out” approach makes functional selection challenging to answer if nonlinear effects exist. We develop an additive Cox PH model to address these challenges in high-dimensional data analysis. Notably, we impose a novel spike-and-slab LASSO prior that motivates the bi-level functional selection on additive functions. A scalable and deterministic algorithm, EM-Coordinate Descent, is designed for scalable model fitting. We compare the predictive and computational performance against state-of-the-art models in simulation studies and metabolomics data analysis. The proposed model is broadly applicable to various fields of research, e.g. genomics and population health, via the freely available R package BHAM (https://boyiguo1.github.io/BHAM/).},
