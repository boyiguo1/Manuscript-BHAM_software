\section{Discussion}
In this article, we introduce the R package \texttt{BHAM} to fit Bayesian Hierarchical additive models with two-part spike-and-slab LASSO prior for high-dimensional data analysis. The R package can be widely used to analyze  large-scale molecular and clinical data with the flexibility to model both linear and nonlinear signals, and hence provide improved prediction accuracy. Meanwhile, compared to the more complicated machine learning method, the additive models can provide more interpretable inference of the underlying signals. In addition, the two-part spike-and-slab LASSO prior for smooth function and the EM-CD algorithm provides a natural solution to the bi-level selection problem, without further requirement of thresholding or hypothesis testing. Fitting a high-dimensional Bayesian model is normally computationally intensive. We provide an economic solution by integrate coordinate descent algorithm with the EM procedure. The implementation of the algorithm leverage some commonly used modeling interface form the standard R packages and hence granting robustness.

To help the users to familiarize the utilities of \texttt{BHAM}, we provide a analysis pipeline in this manuscript. We demonstrate the construction of the design matrix, model fitting and tuning, signal selection and visualization, and prediction via the analysis of a simulated data set. Due to the space constraint, we can't showcase all the functionality offered by \texttt{BHAM} for example fitting a Cox proportional hazard model, time-varying effect model, or fitting the model with the  EM-Newton or EM-IWLS algorithms. We recommand the user to visit an interactive website for more details via \url{https://boyiguo1.github.io/BHAM/}.


Optimal goal is to provide interface for optimal customizability.
