\section{Introduction}

High-dimensional statistics has been an indispensable area of research for its high impact in molecular and clinical data analysis. In recent years, there are continuous efforts to make high-dimensional models more flexible and interpretable, aiming to capture more complex signals. One particular family of such flexible and interpretable models is the additive models where predictors are included in the model as an additive function. These high-dimensional additive models serve for two purposes: variable selection and outcome prediction. In high-dimensional statistics, it is common to assume there is only a small subset of predictors that have effects on the outcome, also known as the signal sparsity assumption. \citep{buhlmann2011} The high-dimensional additive models select not only the predictors who have linear associations with the outcome, but also those who inform the outcome prediction with nonlinearity. As a result, they provide more flexible effect modeling and improve prediction accuracy compared to high-dimensional linear models.

There are many proposals on high-dimensional additive models. The main idea of these proposals focus on the application of grouped sparse penalties, for example, group LASSO penalty \citep{ravikumar2009, huang2010} and group SCAD penalty \citep{wang2007, xue2009}, on the coefficients of additive functions. There methods are developed primarily for variable selection and may provide inaccurate estimation of the underlying functions due to the excess shrinkage of the sparsity penalty \citep{scheipl2013}. Thus, the prediction performance will be affected. In addition, these methods take an "all-in-all-out" approach for variable selection, and fails to answer if the underlying signals are linear or nonlinear. To address these shortcomings, Guo and his colleagues proposed the two-part spike-and-slab LASSO prior for generalized additive models \citep{guo2022_GAM} and additive Cox proportional hazards models \citep{guo2022_Cox}. Instead of using the computationally prohibitive Markov chain Monte Carlo approximations, optimization-based EM-Coordinate Descent algorithms are developed for model fitting. Monte Carlo studies and real data analysis demonstrate improved prediction and computation performances compare to the state-of-the-art additive models.

In this article, we introduce an R package \texttt{BHAM} that implements the spike-and-slab LASSO additive models and computationally efficient algorithms. Notably, \texttt{BHAM} provides functions for setting up and fitting various spike-and-slab LASSO additive models, including generalized additive models for various continuous and discrete outcomes and Cox proportional hazards models for censored survival outcomes. The specification of additive functions follows a popular syntax implemented in \texttt{mgcv} \citep{r_mgcv}. We provide a parser function that translates high-dimensional predictors names and their corresponding additive functions to model formulas, rendering convenience to model large datasets with hundreds and thousands of predictors. Other ancillary functions include cross-validation, model summary, and effect visualization. Our objective with \texttt{BHAM} is to offer a friendly user experience that emphasizes statistical validity, computational scalability and utility flexibility for high-dimension additive models.

There are other R packages that facilitate flexible modeling of complex signals via additive models for high-dimensional data analysis. The R package \texttt{COSSO} \citep{r_cosso} implements smoothing spline ANOVA models with the component selection and smoothing operator to analyze generalized and survival outcomes. The packages \texttt{spikeSlabGAM} \citep{r_spikeSlabGAM} and \texttt{sparseGAM} \citep{r_sparseGAM} fits generalized additive regression models with spike-and-slab and spike-and-slab LASSO priors respectively; nevertheless, both packages does not offer analytic support to model time-to-event outcome. The package \texttt{tfCox} \citep{r_tfCox} implements additive Cox proportional hazards models with trend filtering. \cite{scheipl2013} summarized some other scripts or packages to fit additive models published before 2013, including \texttt{spam} \citep{ravikumar2009}, \texttt{hgam} \citep{meier2009} and \texttt{hypergsplines} \citep{bove2011}; unfortunately, these tools are hardly available now due to maintenance issues. One inconvenience shared by the packages is the limited ability to customize additive functions due to the difficulty to formulate the high-dimensional model. In the proposed \texttt{BHAM}, we address this challenge by providing an interface that parses a data frame of spline function specification to model formula, and hence provide greater flexibility compared to previous packages.

The remainder of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we briefly describe the spike-and-slab LASSO prior of smooth functions and the computationally efficient EM-Coordinate Descent algorithm for model fitting. Section 3 demonstrates the analytic pipeline to analyze high-dimensional data with the R package \texttt{BHAM}. We deliver the conclusion in Section 4.
