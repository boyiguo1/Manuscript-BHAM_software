\section{Introduction}
Growing interest in fitting flexible and interpretable models, particular in high-dimensional data analysis, for the purpose of variable selection and predictive modelling. 

Characteristic of these software includes: scalability, fast computation, and model flexibility and implementation easiness. 

\subsection{Literature Review}

We enlist current available packages that have similar functionality, i.e. modeling  to the best of our knowledge. To note, we don't list packages that are unable of handling high-dimensional data, for example the well known R package \texttt{mgcv}, and high-dimensional packages that requires extra steps to construct the design matrix of functional form of predictors (Such implementation can be found with grouped sparse models, for example \texttt{SGL}.)

\cite{Scheipl2013} Summarized the software development of additive models in high-dimensional data analysis before 2013.

\subsubsection{Generalized Additive Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{COSSO}
\item \texttt{spikeSlabGAM}
\item \texttt{sparseGAM}
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Additive Cox Proportional Hazard Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{COSSO}
\item \texttt{tfCox}
\end{itemize}

In this article, we focus on the packages that can directly construct additive models for high-dimensional data analysis, instead of requiring additional step of constructing design matrix of functional form of the variables before fitting a sparse model. 

There are other methods to model survival outcome and provides proporitonal hazards interpretation, for example \cite{Marra2021} provides a link-based survival additive model for mixed censoring in package \textt{GJRM}.
